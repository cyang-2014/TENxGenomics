\title{Create a 'SummarizedExperiment' from an 10xGenomics hdf5 file.}
\usage{
tenxSummarizedExperiment(h5path, i, j, rowData, colData)

as.tenxSummarizedExperiment(x, rowData, colData)

matrixSummarizedExperiment(h5path, i, j, rowData, colData)

as.matrixSummarizedExperiment(x, rowData, colData)

dgCMatrixSummarizedExperiment(h5path, i, j, rowData, colData)

as.dgCMatrixSummarizedExperiment(x, rowData, colData)
}
\arguments{
\item{h5path}{character(1) file path to a 1M_neurons_*.h5 file.}

\item{i}{Optional integer(), character(), or logical() index used to subset
rows (genes) of the \code{TENxGenomics} object.}

\item{j}{Optional integer(), character(), or logical() index used to subset
columns (samples) of the \code{TENxGenomics} object.}

\item{rowData}{Optional \code{DataFrame()} with as many rows as
there are genes in the 10xGenomics file or object. If missing,
an object is created with 'gene' and 'genename' fields from the
hdf5 file.}

\item{colData}{Optional \code{DataFrame()} with as many rows as
there are samples in the 10xGenomics file or object. If
missing, and object is constructed from the barcodes of the
hdf5 file. The sequence and library portions are separated, and
the mouse is inferred (libraries <= 69 are from mouse "A",
others are from mouse "B").}

\item{x}{A \code{TENxGenomics-class} instance.}
}
\value{
\code{tenxSummarizedExperiment()} and
    \code{as.tenxSummarizedExperiment()} return a
    \code{SummarizedExperiment} instance where the assay() data are
    represented as a \code{TENxGenomics} object. Down-stream
    analysis will typically extract this object from (a subset of)
    the SummarizedExperiment, and coerce it to a, e.g,. matrix,
    \code{as.matrix(assay(se[, 1:100]))}.

\code{assay()} and \code{assays()} must use
    \code{withDimnames=FALSE} when called on a
    \code{tenxSummarizedExperiment}-created instance; dimnames are
    from the underlying file rather than SummarizedExperiment.

\code{matrixSummarizedExperiment()} and
    \code{as.matrixSummarizedExperiment()} return a
    \code{SummarizedExperiment} instance where the assay() data are
    represented as a \code{base::matrix} object. There are
    practical limits to the size of this object (e.g., 20k
    samples); the code is most efficient when consecutive samples
    are selected.

\code{dgCMatrixSummarizedExperiment()} and
    \code{as.dgCMatrixSummarizedExperiment()} return a
    \code{SummarizedExperiment} instance where the assay() data are
    represented as a \code{Matrix::dgCMatrix} object. There are
    practical limits to the size of this object; the code is most
    efficient when consecutive samples are selected.
}
\description{
The SummarizedExperiment \code{assay()} contains the
    \code{TENxGenomics} object corresponding to the underlying hdf5
    file. It also contains row and column annotations provided by
    the user or inferred from the hdf5 file. Inferred data requires
    a simple match between the file name prefix and
    \dQuote{1M_neurons_}; if the file name prefix does not match,
    row and column annotations are not created.
